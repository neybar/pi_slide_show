# Task Execution Workflow

## Instructions

1. **Read and Analyze TODO and Progress**
   - Read the entire `TODO.md` file
   - Read the `progress.md` file to understand what has been completed
   - Analyze all pending tasks (those without `[x]` checkmarks)
   - Identify the most important task to work on next
   - **Important:** The most important task is NOT always the first uncompleted task
   - Consider dependencies, risk, and logical order
   - If there are no more pending tasks, print: `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` and stop

2. **Execute ONLY One Task**
   - Work on the single most important task you identified
   - Complete ALL checkboxes within that task
   - Do NOT proceed to any other tasks
   - Follow all instructions and commands specified in the task
   - **Use matching skills** to enhance task effectiveness (see step 2.5)

2.5. **Leverage Available Skills**
   Match the task type to available skills for better results:
   - **Architecture/design tasks**: Use `/architect` before implementation
   - **JavaScript implementation**: Use `/js-coder` for complex code
   - **Test improvements**: Use `/review-qa` to identify gaps and strategies
   - Skills augment your capabilities - use them proactively, not just for review

3. **Run Tests**
   - Run the test suite: `npm test`
   - All tests must pass before proceeding
   - If tests fail, fix the issues and re-run
   - For new features, ensure adequate test coverage exists

4. **Code Review Agent**
   - Run `/review-nodejs` to invoke the Node.js code review agent
   - Address all CRITICAL issues before proceeding
   - Address IMPORTANT issues if feasible
   - Document any SUGGESTIONS deferred for later

5. **Documentation Review Agent**
   - Run `/review-docs` to invoke the documentation guardian
   - Fix any CRITICAL documentation issues
   - Resolve INCONSISTENCIES between files (README ↔ package.json ↔ TODO.md)
   - Update any STALE references

6. **Update Documentation**
   - Review the `README.md` file
   - Update it if the completed task requires documentation changes
   - Ensure consistency with package.json, Dockerfile, and TODO.md
   - If no updates needed, skip this step

7. **Update TODO**
   - Mark all checkboxes for the completed task as `[x]`
   - Add any new tasks discovered during execution
   - Update task descriptions if needed

8. **Write Progress Report**
   - Update `progress.md` with a summary of the completed task
   - Include:
     - Date and time of completion
     - Task number and title
     - What was accomplished
     - Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
     - Next recommended task (if applicable)
   - Keep the format consistent and chronological

9. **Create Git Commit**
   - Stage relevant changes
   - Create a descriptive commit message following the project's conventions
   - Include `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
   - **Do NOT push** unless explicitly instructed

10. **Stop Processing**
    - After creating the commit, STOP
    - Do NOT proceed to the next task
    - Do NOT analyze remaining tasks
    - Wait for next invocation

## Task Priority Guidelines

When selecting the most important task, consider:

1. **Dependencies:** Tasks that unlock other tasks should be done first
2. **Risk:** Preparation and backup tasks before destructive operations
3. **Logical Order:** Directory setup before file modifications
4. **Safety:** Testing and validation before production deployment
5. **Context:** Don't start production tasks during off-hours without explicit permission

## Example Task Selection Logic

- If "Create backup" and "Modify production config" are both pending → Choose "Create backup" first
- If "Update config file" and "Create directory structure" are both pending → Choose "Create directory structure" first
- If "Execute migration" and "Test services" are both pending → Choose "Execute migration" first
- If only "Monitor for 24 hours" remains → This requires time, not immediate action. Ask user if they want to proceed or wait.

## Commit Message Format

```
<Task title>

<Detailed description of changes>
- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

## Important Notes

- **ONE TASK ONLY:** Complete one task per invocation
- **STOP AFTER COMMIT:** Do not continue to next task automatically
- **ASK FOR PERMISSION:** For production-impacting tasks (deployments, migrations), confirm with user before executing
- **FOLLOW CLAUDE.md:** Always adhere to project guidelines in CLAUDE.md
- **GIT WORKFLOW:** Never commit directly to master; use feature branches
- **TESTS MUST PASS:** Never commit code with failing tests
- **REVIEWS REQUIRED:** Both `/review-nodejs` and `/review-docs` must pass before committing
- **NO CRITICAL ISSUES:** Address all CRITICAL findings from review agents before commit
- **USE SKILLS PROACTIVELY:** Match tasks to available skills (`/architect`, `/js-coder`, `/review-qa`) for enhanced effectiveness
